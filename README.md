# $k8$pots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$k8$pots is a web application that helps skaters-of-many-spots to keep track of all their skateboarding spots, specifically the spots that they hope to skate someday--Someday Spots--and spots that they have previously skated--Other-Day Spots.

## Motivation A
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$k8$pots was the final-project, that is the Capstone Project, for the coding bootcamp that I attended from April 2018 to October 2018--Galvanize.  Students were given ten-days to create a full-stack web application of their choosing. The application needed to be able to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE from a database.  We worked alone on this project and had to use all of the skills we have learned over the past six-months here at Galvanize.  Additionally, a requirement was to learn a brand-new major technology during this ten-day period.  For me, this new technology was the React front-end framework.

## Motivation B
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual who likes to skate several different spots, both for variety and depending on what kind of skating I'm up for, I wanted to create an application that can keep track of all these spots.  Having the specifics as far as addresses go can be crucial if you wanna find that spot (for the first time or for that next time).  Plus, it's good to have some pictures in order to be able to keep in mind what the spot has to offer and to show your friends.
